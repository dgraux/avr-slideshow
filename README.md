=============

A simple slide presenter with an ATmega168  

Idea
----

Basically, the goal is to provide a simple device to make some presentations.  
Everything is loaded in a small microcontrolor. The output is a simple video wire (like the yellow ones behing your tv).  

Directories
-----------

'firmware' = sources to flash the microcontrolor  
'hardware' = a brief description of the circuit  
'releases' = hex files ready to be loaded on a microcontrolor
